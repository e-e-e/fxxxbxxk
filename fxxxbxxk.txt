this is an open question
it is concerned with control

what is this
this is linked to my facebook account
what you are seeing are live updates
this program automatically and with little rationality likes things
posts
comments
whatever

open question,
what if we all added noise to our accounts?

indiscriminately liking,

adding friends,

posting

sharing.

not as sean dockray has proposed,
as a way to suicide through taking every action possible, but no.

no.

no.
rather to collectively disrupt the efficiency of the data collection algorithms and our inevitable commodification in the so called like economy. 

Add dust to the circuitry.

there are two ways -

perform
adopt false personas
reclaim the utopian attitudes of the early internet
those days of masquerades and anonymity

or . . .

automate it
dont think about it
let a program do it.
download this work, modify it to suit your needs.

what is this

this is not a rejection of facebook
it is not that simple

i use facebook
and it is useful
but we need to remember that it is not free

the cost of using facebook is the commodification of you and your data

the cost is selling your identity

facebook targets advertisements to you
based on their virtual model of you
this model is constantly being updated
revised, and sold to advertisers

Even Edward Bernays would blush
as our feeds are manipulated to study our reactions

and of cause, this is all to make our experience more enjoyable. the algorithms are there to tailor content to your desires.

to make it better for you

only show you what you want to see

it is for you
for us

at least that is the sales pitch

facebook currently has a market cap of 203.8 billion us dollars

But what if you added noise
subtly,
not destructively
just enough to undermine their modeling of you
would this ruin your experience?
or would it be an owning of your data
of your actions
would it be the only possible agency within the opaque system.

why do we accept their terms and conditions?
i am not sure where I stand on this.

i use facebook

I think of Rousseau’s concept of the social contract
perhaps only because of the name

social media - social contract

however, unlike rousseau’s contract, facebooks terms and conditions are not negotiable

you have no say

This social contract is one sided. 
“They” decide.
a “they” you will never know.
Your only choice is to accept or opt out.

This social formation is far from socially constructed.
and this raises serious questions.

where is our agency

of course there are alternatives to this,

now there is ello,

before there was appdotnet,

before that diaspora

unfortunately ethical alternatives will always fail
they simply lack capital to compete, 

or they are too similar
google plus

without a critical mass of users they are impotent.

the alternatives also bring to mind the old saying:
Es el mismo perro con diferente collar

so opt in or opt out
or . . .

maybe
lets not abandon facebook
lets claim our own space of autonomy within its unknowable system.

lets generate noise
like
like
like
like

ok so...
this artwork is not really here
it is being performed live on facebook

i am liking indescriminately
not me really
this
but this is me

it has my credentials

on a different note
to those who read contemporary art gloss
this work is not post-internet

post-internet art is the shallow adoption of contemporary internet aesthetics.
it translates one commercial gloss into another commercial gloss.

- the faux universal experience of western internet culture traded in white cubes.
- the heritage of internet art striped of its political potency.

this is not that
this is not for sale
it is free

this is not that
but
rather
a denial of the commodification of our aesthetc experience.

this is a work in progress
