# fxxxbxxk (after Dockray), 2014

An little work made for the exhibition *Futures Knot* at the Lock Up Gallery in Newcastle, NSW.  
This was made in direct response to hearing Sean Dockray read his *Facebook Suicide (Bomb) Manifesto* at the launch of un magazine 8.1. It was an enactment of his provocation - which ended up with me liking some very odd things (McDonalds, football teams, baby products).

See some video of the work -> https://vimeo.com/108249680


## run the work

**note:** This code does not work anymore - Facebook updated how data is rendered to the dom since this code was written.

Requires a file call `config.txt` with your facebook login details:

```
your@email.com,password
```

Two factor authentication must be disabled.

The work is intended to run in terminal - presenting your facebook feed through an ascii aesthetic, while randomly liking posts and comments on your behalf.

open terminal

```
$ cd /dir/where/fxxxbxxk/is/installed
$ python facebook.py
```

You may also need to install python dependencies:

- cookielib
- mechanize
- BeautifulSoup
- blessings
- textwrap


## the script

this is an open question    
it is concerned with control    

what is this  
this is linked to my facebook account  
what you are seeing are live updates  
this program automatically and with little rationality likes things  
posts  
comments  
whatever  

open question,  
what if we all added noise to our accounts?  

indiscriminately liking,  

adding friends,  

posting  

sharing.  

not as sean dockray has proposed,  
as a way to suicide through taking every action possible, but no.  

no.  

no.  
rather to collectively disrupt the efficiency of the data collection algorithms and our inevitable commodification in the so called like economy.   

Add dust to the circuitry.  

there are two ways -  

perform  
adopt false personas  
reclaim the utopian attitudes of the early internet  
those days of masquerades and anonymity  

or . . .  

automate it  
dont think about it  
let a program do it.  
download this work, modify it to suit your needs.  

what is this  

this is not a rejection of facebook  
it is not that simple  

i use facebook  
and it is useful  
but we need to remember that it is not free  

the cost of using facebook is the commodification of you and your data  

the cost is selling your identity  

facebook targets advertisements to you  
based on their virtual model of you  
this model is constantly being updated  
revised, and sold to advertisers  

Even Edward Bernays would blush  
as our feeds are manipulated to study our reactions  

and of cause, this is all to make our experience more enjoyable. the algorithms are there to tailor content to your desires.  

to make it better for you  

only show you what you want to see  

it is for you  
for us  

at least that is the sales pitch  

facebook currently has a market cap of 203.8 billion us dollars  

But what if you added noise  
subtly,  
not destructively  
just enough to undermine their modeling of you  
would this ruin your experience?  
or would it be an owning of your data  
of your actions  
would it be the only possible agency within the opaque system.  

why do we accept their terms and conditions?  
i am not sure where I stand on this.  

i use facebook  

I think of Rousseau’s concept of the social contract  
perhaps only because of the name  

social media - social contract  

however, unlike rousseau’s contract, facebooks terms and conditions are not negotiable  

you have no say  

This social contract is one sided.   
“They” decide.  
a “they” you will never know.  
Your only choice is to accept or opt out.  

This social formation is far from socially constructed.  
and this raises serious questions.  

where is our agency  

of course there are alternatives to this,  

now there is ello,  

before there was appdotnet,  

before that diaspora  

unfortunately ethical alternatives will always fail  
they simply lack capital to compete,   

or they are too similar  
google plus  

without a critical mass of users they are impotent.  

the alternatives also bring to mind the old saying:  
Es el mismo perro con diferente collar  

so opt in or opt out  
or . . .  

maybe  
lets not abandon facebook  
lets claim our own space of autonomy within its unknowable system.  

lets generate noise  
like  
like  
like  
like  

ok so...  
this artwork is not really here  
it is being performed live on facebook  

i am liking indescriminately  
not me really  
this  
but this is me  

it has my credentials  

on a different note  
to those who read contemporary art gloss  
this work is not post-internet  

post-internet art is the shallow adoption of contemporary internet aesthetics.  
it translates one commercial gloss into another commercial gloss.  

\- the faux universal experience of western internet culture traded in white cubes.  
\- the heritage of internet art striped of its political potency.  

this is not that  
this is not for sale  
it is free  

this is not that  
but  
rather  
a denial of the commodification of our aesthetc experience.  

this is a work in progress
